Surround is an Android app that allows users to discover new music by their location within 1000 feet. You can add music to a location by simply listening to songs with your normal media player. You can play songs you discover with Spotify, Pandora, Google Play Music, or Youtube.

## Compiling

### Backend
The backend uses node.js and mongodb. So both must be installed before running the backend.

Once both are installed, simply run the following command in the `backend` directory:

```
npm install
```

Once all packages have been installed, you can run

```
node app.js
```

### Android App
The android app uses gradle, so simplying importing the project in Android Studio using gradle should work.
